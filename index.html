            <p><em>My name is Corey. I'm 24 years old and I'm from Las Vegas, Nevada. Prior to web development, I worked various jobs in retail and a little in the restaurant business before deciding that I needed a change of pace. In August 2015, I decided to pack my things and head (north)west and have been in Seattle, WA ever since. Some of my hobbies include coding, video games, and reading, but my favorite thing to do is take walks in nature. Growing up in a desert has made me appreciate all of the greenery the PNW has to offer. I started my journey as a software developer with Codefellows in April 2016, and plan to make this my full time career!</em></p>

          <p><em>I currently live in a neighborhood called Greenwood, just north of downtown Seattle, with my girlfriend Michelle and our puppy Gatsby. We rescued Gatsby in March 2016 and from what we can determine just by looking at her, she is a mixture of Labrador, Beagle, Pointer, and Rottweiler, although her vet has confirmed that her DNA likely includes a lot of other breeds! My family is my foundation, and has played a major role in my recent career switch.</em></p>
